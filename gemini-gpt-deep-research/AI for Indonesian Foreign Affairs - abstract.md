# abstract

This thesis proposal outlines research for an MSIT degree focused on leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) to enhance public diplomacy for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia (Kemlu RI). It addresses the opportunities and challenges of AI adoption within the Indonesian governmental context, considering the National AI Strategy and global best practices in AI-driven diplomacy. The proposed solution is an AI-enhanced public diplomacy monitoring and analysis system, utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Bahasa Indonesia media. This system aims to provide Kemlu RI with actionable insights from media sentiment and narratives. The research methodology will employ Design Science Research to develop a conceptual model, evaluate NLP tools, and propose frameworks for implementation, personnel training, performance metrics, and ethical governance. The anticipated outcome is a feasible AI project proposal that contributes to academic knowledge on AI in public administration for developing countries and offers a practical, impactful solution for Kemlu RI's modernization and Indonesia's digital transformation goals.
