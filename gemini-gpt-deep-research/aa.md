### ‚úÖ **Understanding "Integrating" in the Context of AI**

In the context of AI, **integrating** typically refers to the process of combining multiple components, models, or techniques to work together as a cohesive system to achieve a specific goal. This may involve:

1. **Model Integration:** Combining multiple AI models, such as integrating a generative model (e.g., GPT) with a retrieval model (e.g., Elasticsearch).
2. **Data Integration:** Merging datasets from different sources to improve training or inference.
3. **Technique Integration:** Applying multiple AI techniques, such as combining natural language processing (NLP) with computer vision for multimodal systems.
4. **System Integration:** Implementing AI components within an existing application, such as integrating a chatbot with a knowledge base or CRM system.

In the context of your thesis, the term "integrating" specifically refers to:

* **Fine-Tuning SahabatAI** with consular-specific datasets to adapt it for domain-specific understanding.
* **Combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to enhance the model‚Äôs response generation by accessing a structured knowledge base or external data source for factual accuracy.

This integration ensures that the chatbot can effectively handle both general conversational queries (via SahabatAI) and specific factual queries (via RAG).
