Security issues and the need for skilled human resources are some of the challenges of AI embassies. Finally, the main achievement of this article is to provide an operational framework for the responsible use of AI in embassies.Conclusion: Designing and implementing an artificial intelligence strategy, ensuring data quality and security, empowering embassy staff, and continuous monitoring and evaluation are the most critical components of this proposed framework.},
